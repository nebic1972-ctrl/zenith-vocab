# Engines Directory
# 
# This directory contains reading engine implementations.
# Each engine (RSVP, Bionic, etc.) should be modular and swappable.
#
# Example structure:
# - RSVPEngine.ts
# - BionicEngine.ts
# - AdaptiveEngine.ts (wrapper that selects appropriate engine)
#
# Philosophy: Engines are isolated, testable, and interchangeable.
